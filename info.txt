Base idea for a user database
-------------------------------
Uses live database.


Two ways to start website:
1.
use "start mongo.bat" and then use "start servers.bat"
2.
Open 3 command prompt windows

from the first command prompt type
mongod

from the second command prompt in folder makingApi type
npm start

from the third command prompt in folder makingClient type
npm start


Website is on
localhost:9000

Api is on 
localhost:3000


to look at database from server point of view
//open up a cmd prompt and type
mongo

use users
show collections
//to see all users
db.users.find()
//to delete all users
db.users.drop()
